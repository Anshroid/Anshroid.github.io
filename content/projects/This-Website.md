## Blog

I've wanted to make a website for a long time. I decided it was a good opportunity for me to practice my frontend skills
while demonstrating the projects I've worked on in a portfolio, so I decided to make this. Possibly the hardest part
about making this website has been actually writing the articles for it! It has been a fun project, however, to put
everything together.
