## CodeSec 2022 Final
This project was created for the CodeSec 2022 final round after winning the [qualifier](/projects/nhs-coordinator), 
for which the theme was the environment. We collaborated to design this project over the span of a week, and ended up
winning the competition.

Take a look at the README on the GitHub repository for information on the project itself.
