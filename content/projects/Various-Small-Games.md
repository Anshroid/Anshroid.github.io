## Blog

Python and Pygame were some of my first experiences in coding, from a Raspberry Pi magazine back in 2015. Over the years
I have developed many small games with Pygame, the most polished of which is Flappy Bird (GitHub linked). Another small
game I've made is [Photosynthesis](https://github.com/Anshroid/Photosynthesis), an idle game demonstrating photosynthesis for GCSE 
students.

I enjoy making silly little projects like these and seeing where they lead. Trying to teach an AI to play Flappy Bird
is on my list, when I eventually decide to learn to train ML models properly!
