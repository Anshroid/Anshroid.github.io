## CodeSec 2022 Final
This project was created for the CodeSec 2022 qualifier round for which the theme was the healthcare sector. We 
collaborated to design this project over the span of a weekend, and ended up winning the qualifier round and qualifying
for the [final](/projects/litterbot).

Take a look at the README on the GitHub repository for information on the project itself.
